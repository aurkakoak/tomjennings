Since 2020, I've played tens of thousands of games of chess. I will never have any idea what the true number is as most of my games are played logged out. I'm still rated < 1600 on Lichess & Chess.com. 

I primarily play Bullet and Blitz, 2+1 & 3+2 time controls. 

### Study, temparment and improvement
I will never be a "good" chess player, a fact I have mostly come to terms with. I find it interesting I'm largely comfortable with the level I've reached, I know taking the next steps upwards would require a significant dismantling and rebuilding of what little I already know about chess. And a lot of effort.

If I analysze what I've written in the preceding paragraph, I would say it represents a fear of failure. 

What would I have to do if I wanted to get better?
#### Study
##### Openings 
I currently play Ponziani as white, and Sicilian Dragon against 1.e4 and Old Benoni against 1.d4 as black. My deep theoretical knowledge is non-existent beyond moves 7 or 8, which is probably fine at my level. I do feel after thousands of games as black with the Dragon, I have internalised the patterns that give black an advantage, 

##### Tactics
I enjoy puzzles to some extent, and they certainly make me a better player. I've found if I can't see a move or tactical idea within 90 seconds, I'm unlikely to ever find it. This is probably a weakness of temprament. 

##### Middlegame
I like sharp tactical middlegames, with lots of tension. If I'm down, I enjoy making the position more complex, I like sacrificing the exchange, or on rare occasions sacrificing a piece, especially if it adds complexity to a position. 

##### Endgame
My endgames are dreadful, I find them very boring to play and study. I find kings slippery and annoying and have frequently lost and drawn (due to time or stalemate) games I'm clearly winning. Even equal posititions I frequently find myself losing due to overly ambitious and ill thought-through endgame play.  

#### Practice
##### Limit blitz/bullet
Whilst I enjoy short time controls, I don't think they contribute to my overall understanding of chess. If they do, it's via osmosis, or rare moments of flow-like clarity, and hours of reflex-driven, unthinking "patzer sees a pawn, patzer takes a pawn" moves. 

For my sins, I'm a relatively quick player, I do enjoy putting the opponent under time pressure, I enjoy thinking on the opponent's clock.  

But I mostly get what I need from being a patzer. 

### Chess Streamers



### Logged out
I found I was becoming increasingly frustrated by rating swings and losing the joy of a chess game. The simple solution was to log out, and play games where you have no idea the skill of your opponent. I wonder who I've played.
